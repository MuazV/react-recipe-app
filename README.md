## React - Recipe App
This project is a comprehensive recipe project I made to learn React Router. I used a different library from regular Css using Style Component for styling. Since there are many examples where I pulled the data with axios before, I got the data from the API with fetch.
Learned with this Project
1. Browser Router
2. Route
3. Routes
4. Styled Components
5. useNavigate
6. Link, Navlink, Navigate
